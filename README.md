## Dataset

The dataset consists of information about U.S. bank customers, providing various details to determine whether a particular customer will leave the bank or not. This dataset includes features such as customer demographics, usage behavior, and other relevant attributes that can help in understanding and predicting customer churn.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a model to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service or business. By utilizing historical customer data, including features like usage behavior and customer demographics, we aim to accurately identify customers who are likely to leave the bank. This model will help in taking proactive measures to retain customers and improve business performance.
